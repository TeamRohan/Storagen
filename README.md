User Stories

Objective: Create a platform where students can find others who are willing to lend spaces for storage

Be able to register both lenders and occupiers. In other words, when registering, first determine the location of the user based on the nearest college within a certain radius. Then, allow user to complete profile with contact information and whether he/she is a lender or occupier. If lender, ask questions about the storage space (size, length of time, etc.). Ask similar questions to occupier as well.

Create a simple messenger app for the lender and occupier to connect and message about updates.

Create notifications to allow lenders and occupiers to receive live updates.

Display location of storage space on a map using an API.
